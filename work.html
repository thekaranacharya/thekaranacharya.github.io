      <h3>Vehicle detection & Classification on Indian streets</h3>
      <p>
        Trained an object detection & classification model to detect vehicles on the crowded streets of
        India and classify them into the following types :<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Car</li>
          <li>Bus</li>
          <li>Truck</li>
          <li>Two-wheeler (Mopeds & Motorbikes)</li>
          <li>Three-wheeler (Rickshaws & Tempos)</li>
        </ul>
        The model was trained using CCTV footage obtained from different streets in India
        - highways, expressways, city streets, etc. <br>
        <strong>Tools & Frameworks used : TensorFlow, ImageAI, LabelImg </strong><br>
        <h4>Result:</h4>
        The model is able to detect and classify vehicles from both - images & videos with a
        <strong>Mean Detection Probability - 90%</strong>! <br>
        Following is the output on an image never seen by the model : <br>
        <img class="result" src="img/output-4.jpg" alt="output-4"> <br>
        As you can see, in such a crowded street, the model is able to detect a truck (even just the back of one),
        a car, and multiple two-wheelers and rickshaws (with some probabilities over 96%!)

      <h3>Novel Poetry Generation using NLP</h3>
      <p>
        Generating a novel Irish poem using a set of Long Short-Term Memory cells (Recurrent Neural Networks).<br>
        <strong>Tools & Frameworks used : TensorFlow-Keras </strong><br>
        <h4>Result:</h4>
        <img class="result" src="img/novel-poem.png" alt="novel-poem"> <br>
        "Then came a sailor" was the only set of words I provided to the trained model as a starting line.
        The next 100 words have been generated by the network! <br>
        P.S. If you look closely, there are very less repetitions in the predicted words. <br>
        It's quite common to see a large number of repeated words in an NLP model prediction.
        Such best results were achieved after carefully tuning the model and the hyperparameters.<br>

      <h3>A comparative analysis of different Keras layers to detect sentiment from tweets</h3>
      <p>
        Performed a comparative study of the effects of different Keras layers - LSTMs, GRUs and Conv1D on
        the Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6M tweets.<br>
        The following combinations of the layers were studied and those many number of models were built and used to predict the sentiment :
        <ul>
          <li>Using only the Keras Embedding & GlobalAveragePooling1D layer</li>
          <li>Embedding with a Bidirectional LSTM layer</li>
          <li>Embedding with a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer</li>
          <li>Embedding with only a pair of Conv1D and MaxPooling1D layer</li>
          <li>Embedding with a pair of Conv1D and MaxPooling1D layer and 1 Bidirectional LSTM layer</li>
          <li>Adding Dropout regularisation to the previous combination.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Tools & Frameworks used : TensorFlow-Keras </strong><br>
        <h4>Result:</h4>
        <img class="result" src="img/comp-study.png" alt="novel-poem"> <br>
        The best results were achieved on the very last combination. <br>
        This was the only model in which the validation loss did not increase sharply i.e
        <strong>the confidence in predictions did not drop drastically over the range of the epochs</strong>.<br>
